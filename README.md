This is Entry Mid Level task where essential skills are shown.

API integration was implemented following the documentation from: https://dummyjson.com/
This application features a Login page, after which you can access the Product page (in the first tab) and the Sorting page (in the second tab). In the app bar, there is a profile section that displays personal information, where you can also change the app's theme.
On the Product page, a list of all products is fetched, and you can access a detailed view of each product. On the Sorting page, a sorting functionality was implemented within the Flutter application. The task involves generating a large list of random numbers, sorting the list using the fastest algorithm, and displaying the time taken for the sorting operation. The challenge of this task is managing the processing of large data asynchronously while ensuring that the user interface remains responsive.
GoRouter was used for navigation, a refresh token was implemented upon expiration, a splash screen was added during app startup, Flutter Secure Storage package was used for storing the token and pagination was implemented. The code is clean and readable.
